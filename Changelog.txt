=== Version/Release 0.2.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2018.06.28; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Refactoring.

- [2018.10.20; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added some code to simplify
  some of the syntax normally used by ClamAV signatures, and added some code to
  remove some specific signatures during the signature file generation process
  that can otherwise sometimes trip up PCRE during the scan process.

=== Version/Release 0.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.08.22; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added new options for offsets in
  signatures. Removed some duplicated code. Removed processing for terminal
  offsets (I don't think these really exist in ClamAV signatures, and what I
  was treating as these in the ClamAV signatures, are for something else, that
  we don't need for phpMussel, and I'd misunderstood about them before).

- [2017.08.29-09.05; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian,
  Dutch, and Portuguese. This totals 7 different language versions of the
  README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.05; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved progress display.

- [2017.09.10; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Vietnamese. This totals 8 different
  language versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.16; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Chinese (simplified and traditional). This
  totals 10 different language versions of the README documentation now
  available.
